Prosidy is a markup system designed around a simple and flexible syntax.
It doesn't try to prescribe how a document should be writtenâ€”
rather, it makes few assumptions about the underlying structure.

This document lays out how tools should handle basic behavior
so that documents are parsed, serialized, and validated
in a way that makes portability to other systems possible.

#-note[level: 'caution']:
  #b{This document is a work in progress.}

  It is likely to be revised multiple times as Prosidy evolves.
  Please wait until finalization before implementing this specification.

  To provide feedback, request changes, or contribute to development,
